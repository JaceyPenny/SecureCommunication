# SecureCommunication
A simple system for two users to communicate securely.

This scenario is described as follows:

Communication scenario: Alice (as a Client) needs to send messages to Bob (as a Server). Either TCP or UDP is fine for the transport protocol. Both messages must be encrypted and integrity- protected. Each of Alice and Bob has a pair of <public key, private key> under the RSA cryptosystem (their key pairs are different), and they know each otherâ€™s public key beforehand (the public keys can be hard coded into the program or sent to each other).
